sayyuf shaik long time ago I read a great analogy for explaining the difference between the two. I don't remember where I read it so unfortunately I can't credit the author for the idea, but I've also added a lot of my own knowledge to the core analogy anyway. So here goes:

A stream socket is like a phone call -- one side places the call, the other answers, you say hello to each other (SYN/ACK in TCP), and then you exchange information. Once you are done, you say goodbye (FIN/ACK in TCP). If one side doesn't hear a goodbye, they will usually call the other back since this is an unexpected event; usually the client will reconnect to the server. There is a guarantee that data will not arrive in a different order than you sent it, and there is a reasonable guarantee that data will not be damaged.

A datagram socket is like passing a note in class. Consider the case where you are not directly next to the person you are passing the note to; the note will travel from person to person. It may not reach its destinat
